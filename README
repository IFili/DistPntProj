A calculator that calculates the prices of the 3 different shipping suppliers

The features of the calculator are:

1. A customer can input the dimensions of the package (width, height, depth) as 
well as the weight.
2. The price for shipping the package is calculated based on dimensions and 
weight. Calculations are based on the logic described in the table above.
3. The final price for the package is the most expensive calculation based on 
dimensions and weight. For example, if based on dimensions the price is €20, 
and based on weight the price is €35, the final price is €35.
4. The details of the package are captured by the web application so it can be 
analysed later.
5. The package price is displayed to the user.
